                    <h3>HIDALGO: Heterogeneous Intrinsic Dimensionality ALGOrithm</h3>
                    <p> A fundamental paradigm in machine learning is that a small number of variables is often sufficient to describe high-dimensional data, where
                        Intrinsic dimensionality (ID) is the minimum number of variables required. In most approaches for dimensionality reduction and manifold learning,
                        the ID is assumed to be constant in the dataset.
                        However, this assumption is often violated in the case of real-world data.
                        Heterogeneous ID allows for data to be represented by a mixture model on the support on the union of K manifolds with varying dimensions.
                        Points are then assigned to manifold k with corresponding dimensionality.
                        Hidalgo extends this concept to a Bayesian framework which allows the identification (by Gibbs sampling) of regions in the data landscape where
                        the ID can be considered constant.
                        As such, Hidalgo offers robust method for unsupervised segmentation of high-dimensional data.</p>

                    <h3>STRAY: Search TRace AnomalY outlier estimator</h3>
                    <p>STRAY is an extension of HDoutliers, a powerful algorithm for the detection of
                        anomalous observations in a dataset which has (among other advantages) the
                        ability to detect clusters of outliers in multi-dimensional data without
                        requiring a model of the typical behavior of the system. However, it suffers
                        from some limitations that affect its accuracy. STRAY is an extension of
                        HDoutliers that uses extreme value theory for the anomolous threshold
                        calculation, to deal with data streams that exhibit non-stationary behavior.
